    "The dataset used for this project comes from a research group in UBC’s Computer Science department that collects information about player activity on a Minecraft research server. Two main files were provided: players.csv, containing player-level attributes, and sessions.csv, which includes detailed logs of individual play sessions. The players.csv file has 196 observations and 7 variables, while the sessions.csv file includes 1,535 observations and 5 variables. After cleaning and inspection, I found that players.csv provides key information such as a unique player ID, the total hours each player has spent in the game, and their age. The average number of hours played is approximately 5.85 hours, while the mean player age is 21.14 years. The sessions.csv file records data for each play session, including start and end timestamps, player identifiers, and session durations.\n",
    "\n",
    "I parsed the timestamps in UTC and computed session durations in seconds. Eight sessions contained missing or negative durations, which I excluded from further analysis as likely logging errors. The time data were then grouped into 15-minute intervals to track how many players were active during each time window. This process produced 32,554 time windows with an average of 2.38 concurrent players, a standard deviation of 1.42, and a 95th percentile value of 5 concurrent players. These descriptive statistics reveal that the typical server load is fairly light but occasionally spikes, which underscores the importance of accurate demand forecasting for resource planning.\n",

    "To answer our question, we will build a regression-based model to predict usage intensity (number of simultaneous players) based on explanatory variables such as time of day, day of week, and recent activity. This method is appropriate because our response variable is numerical and we want to understand how time patterns influence demand. The main assumptions are that usage patterns repeat over time and that past behaviour can help predict future usage. A limitation is that sudden changes in player behaviour may reduce accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will process the data by first cleaning timestamps and summarizing player counts per hour. We will split the data once into a training set (80%) and testing set (20%) after preprocessing. We may also use cross-validation on the training set to compare models and select the best one based on prediction error.\n"
